A simple project to play around with XState.

Project will be based around a crossroads with traffic lights.

- user can push the pedestrian button, user must wait until end of green wave.
- then all traffic stops and the pedestrian lights activate, blink red then go red. Cycle begins again until pedestrian button is hit.
- visible timer on screen

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
